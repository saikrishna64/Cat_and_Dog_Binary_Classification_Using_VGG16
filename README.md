      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This project aims to build a binary image classifier to distinguish between cats and dogs using the VGG16 architecture. The VGG16 architecture is a deep convolutional neural network that has shown great success in many computer vision tasks. In this project, we will use transfer learning, where we will use the pre-trained VGG16 model and fine-tune it on a smaller dataset of cats and dogs.</p>

      <h2>Dependencies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keras</li>
        <li>TensorFlow</li>
        <li>NumPy</li>
        <li>Matplotlib</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>The project can be run using the following command:</p>
      <code>https://github.com/saikrishna64/Cat_and_Dog_Binary_Classification_Using_VGG16/blob/main/Binary_Classification_Using_VGG16.ipynb</code>
      <p>The project uses the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data">here</a>.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project demonstrates the power of transfer learning in building image classifiers with a small dataset. By fine-tuning the pre-trained VGG16 model, we were able to achieve a high accuracy in classifying cats and dogs. The code can easily be adapted to other binary image classification problems with a small dataset.</p>
